       <p> This is logo made for the 80 Years of Marketing Education. I had to learn exactly the context of "what is a logo?" I had to ask myself how this logo will really showcase Marketing Education. This is what I came up with, and my logo won. </p>

       <p> This was a program-wide project to teach elementary school kids how to code. I was assigned with the task of being Content manager. This means that I was in charge of deciding exactly what the kids will learn through code and how they will learn it. </p>

       <p> Upon request by our school faculty, we were asked to make a draft of what could possibly be the look of our school website. We were tasked with making something sleek, modern, but still eveloped with school spirit. </p>

       <p> This was a powerpoint presentation made in Biology for the stomach. Being the first big presentation in my freshman year of school, you can definitely see the improvement from then to now. </p>
       
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s516RhoJ63BBWlr4MuL4QpJltGXlTRobBSquyqh5l1M/edit?usp=sharing"><img src="_assets/media/professional3.jpg" width="300" height="300" style="border:none" alt="name"/></a>

       <p> This edit shows my skills in layering to highlight a person's features. Before, I would just topple on layers to make an image look "coolor." However this time, each layer I added creates more definition. </p>

       <p> This was an easy photoshopping activity created in order to show teens who do not know how to graphic design the basic steps. I had to keep in mind their level of skill when creating the activity, giving a bit of a challenge. </p>
