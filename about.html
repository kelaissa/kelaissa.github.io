            <p>Hello everyone! My Name is Keena Elaissa, and I am an 12th grader at Southwest Career and Technical Academy. My passion in life is to create- create anything really. I love to think up crazy ideas, the kinds which are fun to come up with, but impossible to recreate. Originality is my strive, and a good design aesthetic is paired along with it. During my free time, I love to go out and explore Las Vegas, perhaps take a nice photo every now and then. As I continue on with high school, I can only hope to increase my portfolio with many examples showing my growth and progress as a graphic and web designer. </p>
